## Getting Started

---

To set up the project locally for development, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `server-side` directory:
    ```bash
    cd server-side
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `server-side` directory and add your environment variables (e.g., database connection string, port, etc.).
    ```
    # Example .env content
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    ```
4.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or node server.js (if your start script is not defined)
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `client-side` directory:
    ```bash
    cd client-side
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `client-side` directory and add your environment variables. Ensure you point to your backend server.
    ```
    # Example .env content for React
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
    *(Adjust `REACT_APP_API_URL` based on your frontend framework's convention if it's not React, e.g., `VITE_APP_API_URL` for Vite, `VUE_APP_API_URL` for Vue CLI, etc.)*
4.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    The client application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
